##### Homework 7 due Friday April 10 by midnight
## Please read through the whole assignment before starting it.

## For the assingment you will work with the full text of the 
## State of the Union speeches from 1790 until 2012.
## The speeches are all in the file "stateoftheunion1790-2012.txt".

## You will first read the text into R and manipulate it in order to 
## create a dataframe with information about each speech 
## (President's name, year and month, length of the speech, #sentences, #words)
## You will also create a list that contains the full text of each speech,  
## which in turn is used to create a word vector of *all* words that appear
## in *any* if the speeches - and to count their occurrances in each speech.

## You will then be able to make some comparisons of the speeches/presidents.

## The package SnowballC has a function to find the "stem" of dictionary words.
## Please install it on your computer, using: install.packages("SnowballC")
## but do NOT include that install statement in this file.
## Load the library:
library("SnowballC")

## STOP : Have you done : Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location ?

## We provide a function [ computeSJDistance() ] to calculate the 
## Shannon-Jensen divergence between two word vectors.
## The function is the file computeSJDistance.R, please *keep* the source
## statement in the file:
source("computeSJDistance.R")

## Use regular expression to create: 
## [speechYr], [speechMo], [presidents]

# We start by reading the textfile into the variable [speeches] using readLines().
# Note that readLines() first argument is a connection, 
# and that you can use the R command file() to open a connection.
# Read the help for readLines() and file().
# Check the class and dimension of [speeches].  Open the textfile in 
# an editor and compare it to [speeches]


con <- file("stateoftheunion1790-2012.txt", "r", blocking = FALSE)
speeches <- readLines(con)
class(speeches)
dim(speeches)
# The speeches are separated by a line with three stars (***).
# Create a numeric vector [breaks] with the line numbers of ***.
# Create the variable [n.speeches] a numeric variable with the number of speeches
# Question: Does every single *** in the file indicate the beginning of a speech?

breaks <- grep("[*][*][*]",speeches)
first_speech <- grep("George Washington, State of the Union Address, January 8, 1790",speeches)
last_speech <- grep("Barack Obama, State of the Union Address, January 24, 2012",speeches)
n.speeches <- last_speech - first_speech + 1
#n.speeches<-length(breaks-1)

# Use the vector [breaks] and [speeches] to create a 
# character vector [presidents]
# with the name of the president delivering the address
presidents <- speeches[breaks[-length(breaks)]+3]
presidents_uni <- unique(presidents)

# Use [speeches] and the vector [breaks] to create [tempDates], 
# a character vector with the dates of each speech
# Now, using tempDates create:
# a numeric vector [speechYr] with the year of each speech, and
# a character vector [speechMo] with the month of each speech
# Note: you may need to use two lines of code to create one/both variables.

tempDates <- speeches[breaks[-length(breaks)]+4]
start_year <- regexpr("[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]",tempDates)
speechYr_temp <- substring(tempDates,start_year,start_year+4)
speechYr <- as.numeric(speechYr_temp)
start_month <- regexpr("[[:alpha:]]+",tempDates)
speechMo <- substring(tempDates,start_month,start_month+attr(start_month,"match.length"))

# Create a list variable [speechesL] which has the full text of each speech.
# The variable [speechesL] should have one element for each speech.
# Each element in [speechesL] should be a character vector, where each
# element in the vector is a character string corresponding to one sentence.
# Note: The line breaks in the text file do not correspond to sentences so you have to
# -- collapse all the lines of a speech into one long character string (use paste())
# -- and then split up that string on punctuation marks [.?!]
# Use a for-loop over the number of speeches to do these two steps.
# We define speechesL as an empty list before the for-loop and in
# step i of the for-loop you assign the value of speechesL[[i]]

# Before creating [speechesL] run the following commands to remove 
# some fullstops that are not at the end of a sentence:
speeches <- gsub("Mr.", "Mr", speeches)
speeches <- gsub("Mrs.", "Mrs", speeches)
speeches <- gsub("U.S.", "US", speeches)

speechesL <- list()
for(i in 1:n.speeches)
{
  speechesL[[i]] <- paste(speeches[(breaks[i]+6):(breaks[i+1]-2)],collapse = " ")
  speechesL[[i]] <- unlist(strsplit(speechesL[[i]],"[.?!]"))  
}

#### Word Vectors 
# For each speech we are going to collect the following information:
# -- # of sentences
# -- # of words
# -- # of characters
# 
# We will also create a word vector for every speech.  The word vector 
# should have one entry for every word that appears in *any* speech
# and the value of the entry should be the number of times the word appears.
# The entries should be in alphabetical order.  
# Once all the word vectors are in place we will combine them into a matrix
# with one row for every word that appears and one column for every speech.
#
# Do this in a few steps:
# Write a function, [speechToWords], that takes a character vector and 
# creates a word vector of all the words in the input variable.  
# The function should have :
# Input  : sentences, a character string
# Output : words, a character vector where each element is one word 

# In other words it should take a string of text and:
# -- cut it into words
# -- remove all punctuation marks (anything in :punct:)
# -- make all characters lower case
# -- Remove the phrase "Applause."
# -- use the function wordStem() from the package SnowballC to 
#    get the stem of each work





##################################################################
#-- finally, remove all empty words, i.e. strings that match "" 
#    both BEFORE running wordStem() *and* AFTER
#question, why have ""
#####################################################################






#### The function wordStem() returns the "stem" of each word, e.g.:
#> wordStem(c("national", "nationalistic", "nation"))
#[1] "nation"      "nationalist" "nation"     

speechToWords = function(sentences) {
  # Input  : sentences, a character string
  # Output : words, a character vector where each element is one word 
  
  #sentences <- gsub("[[Applause]]", "", sentences);
  
  word_var <- unlist(strsplit(tolower(gsub("[[:punct:]]","",sentences))," "))
  #word_var <- unlist(strsplit(gsub(" +"," ",tolower(gsub("[[:punct:]]","",sentences)))," "))
  #words_var <- gsub("^applause$", "", words);
  word_var <- wordStem(word_var[order(word_var)])
  
  word_var <- word_var[grep("^[[:alpha:]]+$",word_var)]
  return(word_var)
  # return a character vector of all words in the speech
}

#### Apply the function speechToWords() to each speach
# Create a list, [speechWords], where each element of the list is a vector
# with the words from that speech.
speechWords <- sapply(speechesL,speechToWords)

# Unlist the variable speechWords (use unlist()) to get a list of all words in all speeches, the create:
# [uniqueWords] : a vector with every word that appears in the speeches in alphabetic order


############################
#Unique???????????
#############################
speechWords_vec <- unique(unlist(speechWords))
#uniqueWords <- speechWords_vec[order(speechWords_vec)]
uniqueWords <- speechWords_vec[order(speechWords_vec)]



# Create a matrix [wordCount]
# the number of rows should be the same as the length of [uniqueWords]
# the number of columns should be the same as the number of speeches (i.e. the length of [speechesL])
# the element wordCounts[i,j] should be the number of times the word i appears in speech j

# Use the function table() to count how often each word appears in each speech
# Then you have to match up the words in the speech to the words in [uniqueWords]
# To do that use assignment/indexing and remember : 
# if counts = table(x) then names(counts) is a vector with the elements of x
# and counts a vector with the number of times each element appeared, e.g.
# > x <- c("a", "b", "a", "c", "c", "c")
# > counts <- table(x)
# > counts
# x
# a b c 
# 2 1 3 
# > names(counts)
# [1] "a" "b" "c"

# You may want to use an apply statment to first create a list of word vectors, one for each speech.

# your code to create [wordMat] here:
#/??????????????????????

load("speeches_dataframe_new.Rda")
#load("/Users/yifeiwang/stat133-hw/stat133/hw7/speeches_dataframe_new.Rda")

## Now add the following variables to the  dataframe [speechesDF]:
# yr - year of the speech (numeric) (i.e. [speechYr], created above)
# month - month of the speech (numeric) (i.e. [speechMo], created above)
## Using wordVecs calculate the following 
# words - number of words in the speech (use [speechWords] to calculate)
# chars - number of letters in the speech (use [speechWords] to calculate)
# sent - number of sentences in the speech (use [speechesL] to calculate this)

## Create a matrix [presidentWordMat]

# At the beginning of this file we sourced in a file "computeSJDistance.R"

# where
# terms - a character vector of all the unique words, length numTerms (i.e. uniqueWords)
# df - a numeric vector, length numTerms, number of docs that contains term (i.e. df)
# tf - a matrix, with numTerms rows and numCols cols (i.e. the word matrix)

# Document Frequency
# [docFreq]: vector of the same length as [uniqueWords], 
# count the number of presidents that used the word

docFreq <- apply(presidentWordMat,1,function(x) (length(presidents_uni)-sum(x==0)))


# Call the function computeSJDistance() with the arguments
# presidentWordMat, docFreq and uniqueWords
# and save the return value in the matrix [presDist]

## Visuzlise the distance matrix using multidimensional scaling.
# Call the function cmdscale() with presDist as input.
# Store the result in the variable [mds] by

# First do a simple plot the results:
plot(mds)
pdf("one")


# Customize this plot by:
# -- remove x and y labels and put the title "Presidents" on the plot
# -- color the observations by party affiliation 
# -- using the presidents name as a plotting symbol
plot(mds, main = "Presidents",xlab = "",ylab="")
# Create a variable presParty, a vector of length 41 where each element
# is the party affiliation and the names attribute has the names of the presidents.
# Hint: the info is in speechesDF$party and speechesDF$Pres

# use rainbow() to pick one unique color for each party (there are 6 parties)

cols <- rainbow(6)
names(cols) <- unique(presParty)
# Now we are ready to plot again.
# First plot mds by calling plot() with type='n' (it will create the axes but not plot the points)
# you set the title and axes labels in the call to plot()
# then call text() with the presidents' names as labels and the color argument
# col = cols[presParty[rownames(presDist)]]
presName <-unique(speechesDF$Pres)
plot(mds, type = "n", main = "president", xlab = "", ylab = "")
text(mds,labels = presName,cex =0.7, pos = 1,col = cols[presParty[names(presParty)]])
#text(mds,labels = presName, cex =0.7, pos = 2.5, col = cols[apresParty])

### Use hierarchical clustering to produce a visualization of  the results.
# Compare the two plots.
hc = hclust(as.dist(presDist))
plot(hc)

## Final part 
# Use the data in the dataframe speechesDF to create the plots:
# x-axis: speech year, y-axis: # of sentences
# x-axis: speech year, y-axis: # of words
# x-axis: speech year, y-axis: # of characters
# x-axis: speech year, y-axis: average word length (char/word)
# x-axis: speech year, y-axis: average sentence length (word/sent)

# your plot statements below:
plot(speechesDF$speechYr,speechesDF$sentences)
plot(speechesDF$speechYr,speechesDF$words)
plot(speechesDF$speechYr,speechesDF$chars)
plot(speechesDF$speechYr,speechesDF$chars/speechesDF$words)
plot(speechesDF$speechYr,(speechesDF$words/speechesDF$sentences))
